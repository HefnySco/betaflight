This fork of [BetaFlight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight "BetaFlight") aims to use Betaflight as a framework for accessing sensors, detecting rcinput signals as well as generating output signals.

Flight control logic is not my target here. I am using this as a framework to run STM32 in slave mode via I2C or SPI and controlled by a more powerful biard and flight controller such as [OBAL running Ardupilot on RPI](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-obal-overview.html "OBAL running Ardupilot on RPI")
